Sample workspace that integrates elm, electron and webpack.

After checkout, run the following.

```
# For electron use
make electron
```

or

```
# For browser use
make server
# then open http://localhost:8000/src/static/electron.html
```

Then, go ahead and delete `.git` and gut the project to do whatever.
